This project aims to use a decentralized blockchain model to transport and store data generated by IoT devices in order to bring more safety to the IoT data traffic architecture

The protocol was fully written in Rust language pursuing enough performance to be ran in embbeded and low-powered devices, as most IoT devices

> It was first designed as the Final Project for my Computer Engineering Bachelor's Degree in the Pontifical Catholic University of ParanÃ¡, however there are still some improvements needed in order to achieve production-ready status

### TODO list

The repository is still under early development, below are the next goals in order to achieve some required security features:

- [ ] Block transactions from addresses with null balances
- [ ] Compare received block with local block in order to verify legitimacy
- [ ] Better define when to send local block (now sending whenever reaching 10 transactions)
