This project aims to use a decentralized blockchain model to transport and store data generated by IoT devices

> It was first designed as the Final Project for my Computer Engineering Bachelor's Degree, however there is still some improvements needed in order to achieve a production-ready status

### TODO list

This project is still under development, below are the next goals in order to achieve some required security features:

- [ ] Block transactions from addresses with null balances
- [ ] Compare received block with local block in order to verify legitimacy
- [ ] Define better when to send local block (now sending when reaching 10 transactions)

## ðŸ’» Requirements

All you need to build this project is the latest release cargo version (I am currently using 1.63.0)
